**Mobs**

The mobs are rough in this dungeon, which is why I switched to an attack team brain on Lerky. Mobs caused maybe 25% of my wipes.

**Big Blue Boss and Scarecrow Guy (Don't know the names of these bosses)**

*Team (Front to Back):* Teithyus/Teithyus/Lerky/Lerky/Me

*My build:* Witchum bait w/ 75% evade, 26% block (Seaphim Ascendance), clover, jacket, and 25.5% empower.

I mainly just tried to spam Lerky's 2sp damage front 3 and shock. I wanted lots of attack team procs and EMPs.

**Thebes (Roman Knight Guy)**

*Team (Front to Back):* me/Teithyus/Lerky/Lerky/Teithyus

*My build:* Witchum bait w/ 74% evade, 40% crit (guild accessory), clover, jacket, and 7% empower.

Thebes is a huge pain in the ass. He either spawns with a bunch of DPS fams and they kill you, or he spawns with a tank and it takes forever to kill both of them. On my winning run he took out both of my tanks and it was just me and my Lerkys versus him and his tank alt for about an hour. I kid you not, I sat there for an hour repeating the motions until I eventually got enough multihits with Lerky. I just spammed Lerky's 0sp attack front until he didn't have any shield, then tried to use multiple 2sp hits in a row, repeat if it fails.

I had killed him in a previous run with a mount crit, but you have to get lucky with his teammates -- if he brings the tank fam, you can't use Dracus since the tank teammate has more stamina.
