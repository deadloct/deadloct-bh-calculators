# Dude_WTF's T19 d4 guide (requires divine ward)

**1st the gear setup:**

* Gomo Reaper
* Jacket
* Firent 4/4
* Spirit/Eagle or any fast mount would be optimal
* **divine ward**
* Full DS on runes/ench with one exception: **use one mixed enchant, 1.25% Lifesteal & Empower**
* Other runes: Boli (since you bait and take hits), Chet, and Mayu

**Fams:** team of redirect teith and/or kimu

**Description:**

Power and stam as low as possible. All TS into speed

The high speed and high DS help ramping up firents 3/4 (+30% DS)

Spam the 1sp closest 3 and strongest

The minimal Lifesteal will be enough sustain to make it happen.

All you need are random high output Spikes (qs from ward, firent 4/4)
Thats also why you want minimal empower to keep the possibility of that Spike alive.
