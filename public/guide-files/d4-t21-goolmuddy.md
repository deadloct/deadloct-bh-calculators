__Player__
Stats: 4K atk and 103k speed with the epic mount
All speed everything, Beetle wings, spear, speed evo, firium freeze, jacket, transform neck, - sp regen offhand

__Strat__
1. Go into it with myth mount and switch to epic
2. Transform everyone. Be proactive
3. 6sp fury kzu 2-4 times each (4 max)
4. Use 1sp atk fastest on kzu till 1-2 guys dead
5. If good team make up do transform, sp so kzu can use 3sp, then use big skill on kzu
6. Depending on team makeup adjust
7. Little green nugget guy wipes if more than 2. He is only thing that makes this hard. I had 1 whole dungeon my winning run.
