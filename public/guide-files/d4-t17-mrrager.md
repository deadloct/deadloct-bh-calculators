__WHAT YOU NEED__

- 3 Fully Stabled Glarz. Damage Reduction Pumps, Redirect Bone / Sp Regen Bone, Damage Reduction Chip, **Offensive Brain**. * **If you can reach 65-70 dr with only 2 damage reduction pumps use a third empower pump**

- Leg / Mythic Kolg or Zordrig when hit brain for Glarz
- Aeneas Set
- Leonidas Savior / Thorstien Shield
- Any Ring Placeholder, (Leonidas Claw, Leonidas Wings, Evolvium are my top choices)
- Max T18 TS 51k

- Fam Places: either `Glarz / Glarz / Glarz / You / Oladus` or `Glarz / Teith / Glarz / You / Glarz`
* **If you have lower health then glarz use oladus to be the weakest**
* **If you have higher health then glarz, use Teith to be the strongest**

__HOW TO EXECUTE__

**First Mob Battle** - To compensate for the lack of blinka/quorg/sparkin/or frestir you must make sure your glarz are able to use there Isp shield team skill every single turn they get. To do this, you have to use your aeneas 1sp give sp skill to each of the glarz before they get to their turns. By doing so you should be able to give them max sp and they should in return give you full shields and themselves full shields.

Repeat With every mob fight before a boss. * **If you can build enrage before every boss fight that is great, but I didn't need to with this start**

**Gorobot** - Not much to say about this boss, he can outheal if you do not have Leonidas Savior but if you have a killer dps build / acc / and pet you should have a trouble using thronstien shield or another place holder. * **Alternate hits taken from glarz never have one glarz go under 60hp**

**Pomp Drillo** - It is vital that Pomp Drillo is in the front of the enemies, it will ensure that your glarz with off brains (kolg or zordig) can nuke his HP down so by the time it is your turn you can use either Aeneas Shock Front and Back or Shock Closet 2

Enemies and Cleanse Team, With enough ing you can get drillo to either nuke himself from the glarz or have a one turn kill.

**Tromb** - Like before it is vital that Tromb is in the front of the enemies, it will ensure that your glarz with off brains (kolg or zordig) can nuke his HP down so by the time it is your turn you can use Aeneas Cleanse and Shock Closest 2 Enemies. It is Important that you only use the cleanse team sp skill because if tromb gets another turn he will EMP the 3 glarz in front. If you do not kill within your first turn it if up to your glarz offbrains to kill tromb for you. This is a **SUPER** in based strategy, but it is a work around for doses who don't have the teiths or lerkys and blinkas to clear the conventional way.
