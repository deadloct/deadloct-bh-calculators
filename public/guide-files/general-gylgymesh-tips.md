1.) **Familiars** :power: :stamina: :agility: scale with your own :power: :stamina: :agility:  as you progress & grow. They (Familiars) also grow when you __Stable__ them. You have 2 Bor'lan - you go to the Stable & place 1 inside. Now you have 1 remaining Bor'lan w/ a +1 in stats gained! You can do this up to 5x and then have an Army of Bor'lans with great stats!

2.) **Pets** can be found in the 🏪 and they cost :gem:. They are in Small or Large Pet 🥚 ranging from 200 :gem: ~ 1000 :gem:  (these are always found in the Gear tab in the Game Shop) And on the Featured tab you will see **MEGA or HYPER** variants. A smart option is to __SAVE__ 5,100 :gem: and roll to receive a __guaranteed__ **Epic** Pet. This gear slot is invaluable & offers a huge boost in progression for your Bit Hero. Most often the smartest 🥇 Choice is to roll that 5,100 :gem: on a **Defensive** Pet.

3.) **Brain** A great addition and arguably the 3rd best step in improving your Bit Heroes progression. This adds a "Proc" that "triggers" whether: On Hit, When Hit, or Per Turn. These :brain~1: are assigned to your Familiar/s. And whether you roll a :common: :rare: :epic: or :legendary: you will be __very glad__ that you made the choice to invest some amount of :gem: into your Familiar's growth!

4.) **Accessories** follow the same information found in #2 for Pets // These bolster you even further on your journey as a Bit Hero. (that's it, read #2 and replace __Pet__ with Accessory :BmoDance: 

5.) **Mount** These (much like Familiars) grow with __you__. Every __new tier__ you unlock ❗ Your 🎠 gains more :power: :stamina: :agility: // There are many discussions regarding "Which 🏪  Legendary Mount do I buy???" Much like Pets/Accessories: Save your :gem: If you want to buy a 🏪 Mount out right. These are always :legendary: and have established :power: :stamina: :agility: that never roll :RNG: Same with their Bonus (OFF/DEF) and their 🎠 Skill.

6.) **Gear** Gear, Gear, and MORE Gear!!! There are awesome guides available to explain (Much better than I ever could!) the importance & progression based process with gear while your Bit Hero journeys from tier to tier. :epic: Gear is exceptional & established to be the __best__ method & also saves your materials due to the inexpensive upgrade costs compared to their bigger siblings :legendary: and :mythic: 

I'll End with this bit of info also: Unless you are determined to never need anything along the way during your journey (keeping gear/mounts/pets/acc/etc) then **do not salvage/melt/scrap** your extra [STUFF]. You may find that the defensive Pet with 🛡️ made a chokepoint (Gooz, etc) much easier versus that Offensive Pet you kept dying with.
