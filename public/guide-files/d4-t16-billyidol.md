Here's the Escarium dungeon (z16d4) strategy that I used for future reference. There is probably a much better way to do this -- it took me about 10-20 tries as a full t17 DPS.

**Lineup**
(front) Teithyus (75% evade)/Oladus (63% evade)/me (speed build with t17 Einar + Barkskin + Thornstein Shield + Divine Ward + Dracus mount)/Drazig/Teithyus.

**Trash Mobs**
Kept Genbu in an armory build to swap to him and use its shield mount skill at the end of a trash mob battle. Honestly didn't help that much, but maybe it was enough to pull through.

Used Orvar Bow +0 to bring Oladus back during another trash mob battle. The bow has 2x revives, so I had one remaining at the end of the battle.

Equos is tricky when Oladus dies. Most of its skills are target weakest so it's critical that it is faced with a bait.

**Bosses**
_Haefast_:  I swapped to 2x Teithyus up front to counter his 0SP damage closest. Used my Dracus mount skill against him right away. Focused target skills on Haefast.

_Baga Baya_: I always failed unless Baga Baya was in the front position of his team. Being in front meant that he was very susceptible to Einar's 3SP Flash Barbecue skill, which I used as much as possible against him. Baga Baya's 1SP is an AOE, which was another common cause of my failures.

_Calaveragh_: Focused target skills of fams on Calaveragh. Could be another good target for a mount attack.
