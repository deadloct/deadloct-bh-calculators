**Small adjustment/reminder for the Bit Shop**

Due to recent additions and so on, I can confirm that the two sheets above give the right time on which store sales can occur.

**__‚ö†Ô∏è Of course it should always be remembered that this store can be subject, once again, to unannounced changes and can therefore vary the two usual rotations. ‚ö†Ô∏è__**

That said, I hope that with at least these **two versions** it will help a lot of players to adjust their purchases! 

**‚Üí Quick explanation:** Depending on the new features brought by the developers of the game or by the arrival of an event in game, the store can vary between these two directions. To know in which __sheet__ (rotation) you are, you have to rely on the current **sales** and on the event of the week you are entitled to: Ex: **Gauntlet** or **Trial**.

For any additions, please refer to our Wiki page to find the offers ‚Üí https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/Shop. I will try my best to update what is going on! **Don't hesitate to help me/us, if ever there are adjustments or new things to do or add on this page!**

Thank you all and I wish you a great time on Bit Heroes and on the discord! Keep it up everybody! :Stamina: üí™
