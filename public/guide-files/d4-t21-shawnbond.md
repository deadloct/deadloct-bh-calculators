I passed using Kimu, Kimu, Lerky, Lerky, me. 

Kimusaba had redirect bone, attack weakest when hit brain, damage reduction when all team alive chip, and block pumps.

Lerky had SP regen at full health bone, attack weakest on hit brain, SP does increased damage chip, and empower pumps.

I had Spear of escarium, codex set to defensive for 25% purification, firium helm set to pop freeze, jacket, uxo lace, sacramentum on curse. All speed enchants and runes. Wull and Melgu doritos and Gael. Shokan acc. Mount with low attack and high speed. Turn rate was 841550.

Your job is to continuously keep protection on everyone on your team while feeding SP to your team. Occasionally try to build up fury as your protection bubbles are good still to make for bigger hits. I tried to only use the Destiny Chaser skill on Lerky so that I could pick who I was attacking due to the brains being a main issue on these enemies. Kimu skills don’t matter too much, but he could come in handy as long as a brain doesn’t proc.
