**Trombolini**

*Team (Front to Back):* Teithyus/Lerky/Lady Sparkin/Lerky/Me

*My build:* (All t18 except t17 Elementarium) Fyssas MH, OH, Neck; Elementarium; Soul of Esc (Combust); Weave (ring); Tatooi +4; Dwadin +4; Sherms mount; 4x mythic DR runes; mythic redirect or legendary below 25% healing meta rune; mythic boli; mythic mayu (increased damage not dr since I had enough); 4x mythic block enchants; 1x mythic DR enchant; 1x mythic evade enchant.

This fight is the worst by far. One run I accidentally went into it with Fyssas equipped -- when I meant to be a bait with an offensive pet -- and I survived the initial wave of attacks and soloed the rest. So my strategy going forward was to let everybody on my team die and then solo Tromb. Boli rune kept my SP high so I could just use the Fyssas 3sp to one shot him.

**Pomp Drillo**

*Team (Front to Back)*: Lerky/Teithyus/Lady Sparkin/Lerky/Me (but should have run Teithyus/Lerky/Sparkin/Lerky/Me)

*My build:* (All t18 except t17 Exo Jacket) Witchum MH, OH, Head; Exothermic Jacket; Leonidas Honor (barrier neck); Weave (ring); Honor Cloud (guild honor accessory); Dwadin +4; Dracus (mount); 3x legendary evade runes; 1x mythic evade rune; legendary below 25% healing meta rune; mythic boli rune; mythic mayu rune (increased damage); 2x mythic empower enchants; 3x mythic evade enchants; 1x legendary 1% empower/1% evade enchant.

I was nervous and half-asleep, which is why I put Lerky in front. Best to put Teith in front!

That aside, the goal is to kill Drillo ASAP and not die. I used Sparkin's Protection skill whenever I could on myself. I targeted Drillo with Lerky's 2sp shock 3x skill, and I used Dracus' mount attack on Drillo when I got the chance to finish him off.

**Gorobot**

*Team (Front to Back):* Me/Lerky/Lady Sparkin/Lerky/Teithyus

*My build:* (All t18 except t17 Elementarium) Fyssas MH, OH, Neck; Elementarium; Soul of Esc (Combust); Weave (ring); Tatooi +4; Dwadin +4; Sherms mount; 4x mythic DR runes; mythic redirect or legendary below 25% healing meta rune; mythic boli; mythic mayu (increased damage not dr since I had enough); 4x mythic block enchants; 1x mythic DR enchant; 1x mythic evade enchant.

Gorobot is a long fight but it was by far the easiest for me. The team is a balance between having enough damage mitigation and bringing enough DPS, otherwise I'd die after a long slog or be stuck forever respectively.

In the end I leaned heavily on Fyssas' 3sp attack, using Sparkin almost entirely to give myself extra SP so that when it was my turn I could use the rad Fyssas 3sp. With Lerky, I usually just spammed the 0sp since it has a high damage output and would hit 3 times, hopefully proc'ing his damage strongest brain. When I had a chance to use Sparkin's fury skill, I would try to use Lerky's 2sp shock to hit the target 3 times and EMP. I'm guessing that's not the best strategy for Lerky, but I'm not very familiar with Lerky or shock/emp so ymmv.

I don't know why but the last 5% of Gorobot is the hardest to finish, it's like he has some special coding to heal/shield massively at that point. Eventually you just hopefully out-DPS the healing.
