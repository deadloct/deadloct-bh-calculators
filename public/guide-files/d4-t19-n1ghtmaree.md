**Build used**

Shield of escarium (Mine was T18, just upgraded once to speed)
Firent 4/4
Gomoloid Root Armor (Magmerang body, **star** of the show)
Monarch (or any other higher DS accessory. You need 45% DS, so you can cap DS with Firent 3/4.) I also went 1 life steal enchant.

Other things:

Aeneas mh
Clover (not necessarily needed)

Fams used:

2 +4 Brutows (I used 3 block pumps to get him to 100% block. Redirect bone, "Gain DR when all teammates are alive" chip.)
1 +5 Glarzdos (3 DR pumps, "Gain DR when all teammates are alive" chip. **NO** redirect bone.)
1 +0 Flunder (Doesn't matter, he's used to deflect against Washi)

You need 2 armories. Your normal armory, which will be used to give your familiars **as much TS as possible**, and your speed build armory is going to be used for the dungeon.

Total TS of normal build: 90K
Total TS of speed build: Around 74k (Stat spread was 2,1k attack 13,6k stamina 58k agility)

**Strats:**

I recommend going Washi, then Dr Ediblegh, then Robosawa. Although in the winning run I went Washi, then Robosawa, then Dr Ediblegh.

**Note** with my ts (~90k) glarz has ~17.4k stamina. On my speed build, I had 13.6k stamina. Before fighing Edilbleigh, you want your glarz to be at 70% hp, so he has **lower** hp than you.

Mobs: 
Fam set up: Brutow - You - Glarz - Flunder - Brutow

Get to 4 sp ---> Magmerang ---> repeat
Time to time use the 6sp to cleanse team, and to protect yourself since you're in second slot.

Washi:
Flunder strat
Fam set up: Flunder - Brutow - Brutow - You - Glarz

**Before fighting washi, you want to unequip the redirect bone from Brutow. What can happen, is that the guaranteed deflect can get redirected to Brutow, making the run fail.**

Instead of shield of escarium, just equip aeneas mh. I also equipped clover, but it is not needed. I recommend that you stack enrage beforehand, and enrage the 0sp. Sometimes, you won't insta kill him. In my winning run, I did an enrage 0sp, He didnt die, i did another 0sp, he didn't die. My team was about to get E.M.Pd, so i did the 2sp cleanse team, and that killed him.

Dr Ediblegh:
Fam set up: Brutow - Brutow - Glarz - Flunder - You

Save **A TON** of enrage before edil. Enrage magmerang, and hope for a 1 turn. In the winning run, 2 magmerangs were needed. If you need to revive glarz, ***REVIVE WITH A 60% POT***

Robosawa:
Fam set up: Brutow - Brutow - Flunder - You - Glarz

By far the hardest boss with this strat. In the winning run, only me, a brutow and a flunder were left alive, with everyone having about 5% hp.
Again, magmerang will be used to kill him. However, I am pretty sure you would benefit from having **higher attack**. With lower attack, you end up hitting robosawa more, proccing his brain a lot more often. In the winning run, I used the speed build, just like with Dr Ediblegh.
