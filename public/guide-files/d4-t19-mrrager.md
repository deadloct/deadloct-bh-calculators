**Notes**

Builds:

> [The second build] had a bit more speed but i just used up some gems to respec into my usual attack stats, other than that the freegale was used for dr, but i was able to clear washi and robo with dracus

Runes:

> full ds and one speed rune, and half ds half emp for enchants

Familiars:

> this was my team comp (id use a teith instead of kimu but as you can see, my noob self made demeters 3 tiers ago)
> 
> blee in the back since he eats most of the brain attacks and kimu stopped a lot of mobs with his barrier, but id put him in third and shove the 2 deflect fams in the front for washi and robo so they can deflect back and hope for a quick kill
> 
> all dmg reducuton pumps on kimu and blee and full deflect pumps on the deflect fams, with *VImportant, 30% mythic redirect bone on the deflect fams
> 
> absolutely crucial when fighting dr so he doesn’t  freeze lock you

Other strategy info:

> other than that, the turn order of bosses for me was 1. Robo. 2.Dr. 3.Washi, robos the most inconsistent, dr gets easy after you can cycle him into a good chain of 6sp cleanses, and washi is i consistent as well but a lot easier then robo
> 
> General Rule of thumb, the 6sp skill is generally used throughout the whole run, but if there is only a single enemy left 5sp skill outshines the 6sp, (only for robo) use the 6sp on washi  and dr through out the whole fight so they don’t shock or freeze you
