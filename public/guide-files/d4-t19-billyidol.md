**General Tips**

Dungeon fam augs from Lyme: https://discord.com/channels/608309926569181217/608343048207990795/1027743167971332170. Not all accurate, like washi brain is when he gets hit.

Shield of Esc: 6sp shields the team. Firiums procs on 5sp and 6sp.

Evolvium and Thorstein Shield add revitalize, very helpful in this dungeon but slow af.

The main reason for dual strike is to proc the Bonik Rune (and do dual strike's usual thing).

**Mobs**

Teith/Kimu/Me/Lady Sparkin/Teith (Front to Back)

Skill rotation depended on the amount of shield my team had. With shields, 6sp. Full shields, 5sp.

Lady Sparkin's Protect ability on myself if mob hits weakest.

**Robosawa**

Teith/Kimu/Me/Lady Sparkin/Teith (Front to Back), rotating Teiths regularly to the back when one loses a lot of health.

Robo has an attack strongest when he gets hit brain. 6sp to shield team and not hit Robo accidentally. Protect with Lady Sparkin on strongest, then swing once with 5sp to do more damage if strongest isn't hit between the protect and my turn.

**Dr Ediblegh**

Teith/Kimu/Me/Lady Sparkin/Teith (Front to Back)

Hits weakest hard. Lady Sparkin protect on myself, swing with 5sp whenever possible.

**Washibot**

Kimu/Teith/Me/Lady Sparkin/Teith (Front to Back)

Spammed 6sp or 5sp, but his brain and attacks are brutal. Just have to get lucky.
