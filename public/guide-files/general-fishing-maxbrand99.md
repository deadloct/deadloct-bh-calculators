**FISHING INFO**
Attached are fishing pictures for each bobber. Each one was a perfect cast with the mythic pole. All of them were goldfish.

From elle on fishing cast distance:
> The loot table distribution is based on distance. Longer/further is better, increasing the chance at heavier fish and better rewards from that fish. There are other multipliers, but overall that's how the loot tables work. Fish find is a flat bonus on top of those loot tables.

After testing, fishing distance has zero effect on catch bar size, nor does the bait used.
