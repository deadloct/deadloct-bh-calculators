**Gear**

skyent spear, skyent offhand, sp flamium, jacket, clover, weave

gael rune, ds/emp rune enchant, squeeb on per turn (def pet!!!), my mount was a +5 spirit 

stat spread 3.5k 3.5k 74.6k

**Team**

_pos_: bleex, lerky, lerky, lerky, you (from front to back)

_lerky_: 2x ds 1x emp, attack random brain, drain sp bone (useless cuz sp flamium), more dmg on sp

_bleex_: 3x evade, spread heal shield brain, % evade on first hit brain (dont use redirect), dr chip

**Boss**

_Tomor_: protect first 2 lerkys, let your tank stay around half health and protect him to heal, let him get hit then skill 3 / skill 4 protection juggle so he doesnt heal too much and target shock with lerky, if he uses skill 3 (hit closest 3) 
reapply protect to first 2 lerkys, you should be faster than tomor

_Slug_: have protect on everyone, he has attack random skill, otehrwise its easy just heal and shock target

_Green dude_: protect on first 2 lerkys, protect on you after you get hit, focus on main tank a lot, his 0sp hits weakest so you will ahve to heal yourself quite often. this sounds harder than 

tomor context, if your tank is like halfish hp or not full, tomor will be incentivized to use his skill 1 and try to kill ur tank, that way he doesnt use his sustain. its easier to kill him that way. if your tank is full hp there is more weight on his skill 3 and then you run the risk of him skill 3 again and then both ur first 2 lerkys die.

**Trash**

dont hit green guy with 3 eyes
protect yourself (back slot) against shark guy, make sure to kill him befoer 2nd turn, as he has attack team 1sp and it deals a fuckton of dmg
protect yourself (back slot) against the hamemr guy, MAKE SURE YOU ARE PROTECTED, his 0sp oneshots you (bleed)
always have protect up on yourself for safety, bleed oneshots you (hammer guy and that ugly dog with the book) and shark has very strong brain
everyone else easy
